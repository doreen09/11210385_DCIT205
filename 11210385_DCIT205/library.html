                        <p>
                        This library is air conditioned and has a seating capacity for 218 readers.  The Lending Library stocks multiple copies of prescribed textbooks and other publications, which could be borrowed by users for reading outside the library premises. It also handles the reservation of books, user education and provides assistance to readers.  The Lending Library is also responsible for the registration of users; all simple controlling routines intended to invite and encourage active consultation and usage of documents. This is administered through procedures that are adapted to the convenience of users as far as possible. It is inevitable that there must be some rules governing the borrowing of books if all individuals are to be served equitably.
