                        The University of Ghana is committed to the assurance of 
                        the quality of its academic programmes. This assurance is 
                        expressed broadly in the University’s mission statement “to 
                        create an enabling environment that makes University of Ghana 
                        increasingly relevant to national and global development 
                        through cutting-edge research as well as high quality teaching 
                        and learning.” The overall goal of this Academic Quality 
                        Assurance Policy (AQAP) is to outline the principles and 
                        procedures adopted by the University to demonstrate that 
                        its institutional responsibility for awarding its degrees is being 
                        satisfactorily discharged. The quality of programmes of the 
                        University is shaped currently by a 10-year Strategic Plan (2014-
                        2024) focused on nine priority areas that provide a mechanism 
                        to operationalise the University’s mission and practices

                        The University adopted a Collegiate Governance System in 2014, which allows the monitoring of academic quality at an intermediate central administrative level in its four Colleges, namely, Basic and Applied Sciences, Education, Health Sciences, and Humanities. 
                        The University’s operations are governed by the highest level of integrity, ethical standards, openness and fairness underpinned by a reward and recognition system that is performance driven. This institutional culture encourages students to become committed to academic excellence.

                            Aims
                        </h5>
                
                            The aims of the Academic Quality AssurancePolicy shall be to:</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>satisfy the internal and external stakeholders, that the whole 
                                    range of resources, across academic and support areas, is of 
                                    the highest possible quality.
                                </li>
                                <li>demonstrate that standards of awards are appropriate and that 
                                    resources meet the requirements of the academic infrastructure 
                                    and other external benchmarks.
                                </li>
                                <li>ensure institutional commitment not only to quality assurance 
                                    but also to the enhancement of the quality of the students’ 
                                    experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>implement the University’s approach to quality assurance and 
                                    enhancement in an efficient and effective manner.
                                </li>
                                <li>adopt the approach of integrating, as far as possible, measures 
                                    and methods into routine procedures to reinforce both the 
                                    philosophy and the practice of quality assurance as integral 
                                    parts of normal operation.
                                </li>
                                <li>provide accessible and adequate infrastructure for dealing 
                                    with quality assurance at all levels and for disseminating good 
                                    practice.
                                </li>  
                            </ol>
                            In setting these aims, it is realised that factors such as funding, logistics, availability of sufficient and well-trained staff as well as challenges in information flow militate against the full implementation of the AQAP. Although these limiting factors are 
                            common to all higher education entities, the University of Ghana requires a clearly stated position on its quality assurance position and methods to fulfil its aspiration and mission statement. We will adopt formal, documented expectations accompanied by more 
                            tightly prescribed methods of monitoring both online (virtual) and face-to-face teaching, learning and research.

                            The purpose of the Course Review and Development Procedure is to ensure understanding and a standardised approach concerning curriculum changes and that the appropriate standard of content is assured.

It should be noted 
                            that even where a new programme draws on existing courses, there is the need for accreditation by the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC). This additional time element needs to be allowed for in the planning for the introduction of new programmes

                            Student evaluations of course instructors’ teaching and course content is important for the teaching and learning process. It helps course instructors modify their educational methods to align with student learning needs and can be used as the basis for 
                            evaluations of teaching effectiveness in administrative decisions such as promotion. Rubrics for evaluating teaching will be provided by the AQAU. However, Academic Units are encouraged to develop internal measures to assess and improve the quality of teaching and learning during the semester. Faculty-led evaluation of teaching 
                            may include soliciting feedback from students after the first lecture, mid-semester evaluation or after key milestones defined by the course instructor/lecturer. The AQAU may periodically request for such reports. Such faculty-led evaluation processes may also include online media on the UG LMS such as Blogs, Electronic surveys, Focus Group Discussions, informal feedback. Heads 
                            of Departments must take into consideration international best practices and ensure that course instructors/lecturers emphasise the seven principles of good practice and effective teaching, which are:

                            The University through the AQAU should ensure that there is a procedure in place for dealing with student evaluation of teaching and courses at the end of every semester and the results communicated to the lecturers for that course. All students taking
                            the course should complete a questionnaire that will be prepared by the AQAU. The questionnaire will be analysed by the AQAU and the results sent back to the lecturer through the College, School/Centre and Departments. The Head of Department is to ensure 
                            that key issues that impact on the course and teaching quality are discussed with the lecturer involved. Where it is determined that an issue cannot be addressed by the Department, the Head of Department should ensure that it is brought to the attention of the 
                            University via the Dean to the Provost of the College. Everything should be done under strict confidentiality. The Provost of the College would serve as a discussant in cases where Deans are the course instructors. The findings should be communicated to 
                            students indicating any actions to be taken to address any problems raised, or reasons for not taking action.

                            The AQAU will undertake course and lecture evaluation at the end of every semester. The response rate for an evaluation should be more than 40%. The AQAU should consider ways in which the response rate might be improved in situations where the response 
                            rate is low. Course and lecturer evaluation reports should be forwarded to the lecturer involved through the College, School/Centre and the Department

                                    or history of the intention to mount the course by citing an 
                                    overview of conditions, events and intentions that led to the 
                                    proposal. Alternatively, explain whether it relieves a course
